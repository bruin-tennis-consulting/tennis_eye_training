# Project Ace: VR/AR Tennis Opponent Simulation

## 1. Problem

Professional tennis lacks tools for hyper-specific, first-person POV warmups. Existing methods like film review are passive and fail to replicate the crucial timing and feel of facing a specific opponent's unique shot style.

## 2. Our Solution: Data-Driven VR/AR Training

Project Ace creates an immersive VR/AR training environment using real opponent data. Players practice against data-driven simulations of upcoming opponents, focusing on serve returns and shot recognition.

**Partnership:** We utilize ball movement and player tracking data from the 2024-2025 **UCLA Tennis** season via their Sports Analytics Consulting Team.

## 3. Core Features

*   **Opponent Replication (USP):** Train against the *actual* physics, timing, and placement of specific opponents' shots (especially serves) derived from match data. Experience your opponent *before* the match.
*   **Realistic Physics:** Accurately models collegiate-level ball flight and behavior.
*   **First-Person POV:** Immersive training perspective enhances reaction and recognition.
*   **VR Deep Practice:** Focused drills on specific shots and timing sequences.
*   **Customizable Scenarios:** Isolate and repeat critical match moments.
*   **Multi-Angle Analysis:** Review simulated plays from any viewpoint post-drill.

## 4. Snap AR Integration Concept

Leverage Snap AR to bring data insights onto the real court:

1.  **On-Court Visualizations:** Use phone/Spectacles to overlay opponent serve trajectories, speed, and bounce points during practice or warmups.
2.  **AR Tactical Board:** Project interactive 3D court visualizations onto surfaces for strategy sessions showing opponent tendencies (serve maps, rally patterns).
3.  **AR Drill Guides:** Place AR targets or cues on the court for guided physical practice based on opponent data.

Snap AR makes data actionable and accessible outside the full VR simulation.

## 5. Goal (Snap AR Competition)

Develop the first platform allowing interactive practice against specific, data-driven opponents. We seek to showcase this innovative sports training application within the Snap ecosystem and explore AR's potential for accessible, real-world training extensions.
