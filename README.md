# Eye Tracking Game

A Python game built with the [Ursina Engine](https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina) that simulates a tennis court environment. It features ball physics, realistic bounces with spin, and visual cues like a fading contact marker that shows where the ball changes direction.

## Features

- **3D Tennis Court Environment:** Ground, net, court lines, and a bounding box for better depth perception.
- **Realistic Ball Physics:** Includes gravity, bounce dynamics, and spin.
- **Visual Contact Marker:** A marker appears at the point of directional change and fades over time.
- **Simple & Clean Code:** Designed for readability and ease of modifications.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6+** (tested with Python 3.8+)
- **Ursina Engine**
